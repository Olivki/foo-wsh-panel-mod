All preprocessors is started with "==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "==/PREPROCESSOR==":
  VBSCRIPT:
    ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    ' ...
    ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

  JScript:
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    // ...
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==

And be aware that all preprocessors (directives) are case *sensitive*.

== Directives ==
  Directives should be started with "@", and placed into a single comment.

* @import "path"

  Usage:
    VBScript:
    ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    ' // @import "path"
    ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

    JScript:
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    // @import "path"
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==

  Remarks:
    You can place %fb2k_path%, %fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% into "path", they will be expanded while parsing.
    Escape one double quote (") with two double quotes ("") if path includes double quote(") character. eg: @import "D:\""Something"""
