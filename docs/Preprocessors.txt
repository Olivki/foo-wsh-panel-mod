All preprocessors is started with "// ==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "// ==/PREPROCESSOR==":
  VBSCRIPT:
    ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    ' ...
    ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

  JScript:
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    // ...
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==

NOTE: All preprocessors (directives) are case *sensitive*.

== Directives ==
  Directives should be started with "// @"

* import "path"
  Usage: @import must placed in a single comment:
    VBScript:
    ' // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    ' // @import "path"
    ' // ==/PREPROCESSOR==

    JScript:
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==
    // @import "path"
    // ==PREPROCESSOR==

  Remarks:
    You can place %fb2k_path%, %fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% into "path", they will be expanded while parsing.

  Known Issues:
    Length of "path" cannot exceed 260.
    Including double-quote(") in path is object to "path" syntax.
